Section on Marronage

 Panama is an early and sustained example of marronage (see Mena Garcia, Tardieu), followed later by Mexico, Florida, Cuba, Jamaica, see Helg, Landers, Bennett, Vincent Brown, Vinson…

Examples elsewhere: Ñanga in Nueva España [today Mexico EXPAND], Limón in Nueva Grenada [today Colombia EXPAND], El Cobre on Hispaniola [today Cuba EXPAND] [^2.1] Santa Teresa in Florida [^2.2]

 In the earliest phase of Spanish colonization of the Americas, geographic control was fragmented and varied greatly depending on location. In important centers of mining and colonial administration, built on top of existing sacred

The camino Real as a recreation and adaptation of the existing Mesoamerican trade networks.

. Flight from forced labor and subsequent creation of independent communities outside the grasp of colonial control was practiced since the very early days of the slave trade and colonization in the Americas. Negotiation between Spaniards and the Black, Indigenous, displaced, and dispersed people in contested territory took place in two intertwined . Many communities waged war against the institutions of commercial  with Spanish troops, raided settlements and supply lines, and exhausted the Spanish will and funds to continue military campaigns against fugitive settlements. Other communities recognized the political power of the Catholic Church and used Catholicism and clergy as allies in their quest to maintain secular political authority. In Ecuador, a leader of the free Afro-Indigenous community of Esmeraldas successfully rejected Spanish military and commercial presence by threatening to cut ties with the Church and trusted community priest.[^2.5] Catholic piety was a tool that fugitives could wield both to attain and to maintain sovereignty.

Whether manumission and autonomy were achieved through combat, conversion, or a combination of the two, maintaining that autonomy often meant agreeing at least in part to the terms of _reducción_.  _Reducción_—settlement—was a central principle of Spain’s colonial policy, designed to spatially concentrate Indigenous populations into towns as a means of ensuring social adherence to Christian norms. The association between _urbs_ and _civitas_—the city and the moral obligation it inspired in its citizens—was also connected to Spaniards’ received assumptions from the Reconquista era. “_Vivir alárabe,”_ to live as the Arabs do, was a preexisting linguistic idiom the Spaniards used to refer to dispersed, low-density, or nomadic Muslim populations on the Iberian Peninsula. In the Americas, dispersed or nomadic Indigenous populations were described as living _alárabe_ and were targeted for resettlement into towns in which the expected social, agricultural, spatial, and religious contours of land use were mandated as part of the settlement and resettlement processes.[^2.6] In addition to the expectation of spatial concentration and loyal vassalage, the settlement process needed to be accompanied by demonstration of Christian piety, as the case of Esmeraldas demonstrates.[^2.7]

  One irony of the history of marronage is that by fleeing to remote, interior areas, fugitives often extended the frontier of colonial awareness and possession. I use awareness and possession together here because of those notions’ deeply intertwined relationship in the Spanish colonial imagination; land claims were legitimized through visual epistemologies of representation and depiction, and through ceremonial, ritualized declarations of authority.[^2.3] The challenges of administration were significant in an empire spanning thousands of miles of coastline, millions of acres, and hundreds of peoples and languages. The underlying belief was that the distant sovereign could rule such an enormous expanse through the eyes of his subjects. These soldiers, clergy, lawyers, and judges had seen and described the lands of the Americas. In so doing, and in relating their visual claim to their sovereign, they posited a sort of transitive property of authority: “I have seen and described these lands under the auspices of the King of Spain. Thus, the King of Spain has seen them and has claimed them.” This process was formalized and standardized by Philip II’s geographic questionnaires in the 1580s,[^2.4] but a steady stream of descriptions had flowed out from the Americas since the earliest moments of Spanish presence there. Several examples from late 16th century Tierra Firme reflect these patterns of descriptive engagement with place. Although they are entitled “Descriptive Summaries,” there are of course many unacknowledged layers of textual mediation in these accounts. For example,  Panamá’s senior judge Alonso Criado de Castilla produced such a summary in 1575; but did he himself travel the length and breadth of the region, counting the free and enslaved population, taking note of variations in the climate throughout the year, and so forth? I think not; compiling reports from subordinates and scouts was just the sort of endeavor a judge and chronicler thought himself ideally suited.
