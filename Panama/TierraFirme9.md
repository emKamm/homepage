It was the middle of June 1579, and twenty-eight men were in Panamá to see the presiding judge of the royal court. Likely, most of these men had been to the city before. Maybe they’d lived and worked in Panamá for some time, maybe they’d come to know the city only in between time spent working elsewhere—clearing land for pasture on the city’s outskirts, driving trains of mules across the mountains, diving for pearls on the islands across the bay. These twenty-eight men had been slaves once, yet all claimed freedom on their own terms by taking flight, settling in the mountains in the interior, and defending themselves against Spanish troops sent to re-enslave them. Now this group came to have their freedom recognized by the Spanish crown.
. In 1575, Criado de Castilla estimated the total number of fugitives in Tierra Firme at 2500[^9.1]and these fugitives’ entrenched, well-defended positions in the mountains were sources of serious anxiety for Spanish authorities.[^9.2] Some of these fugitives do not appear at all in the notarial record; others appear only as population numbers or unnamed antagonists. Many of these fugitives appear in the notarial record at the moment of their arrival into a new settlement, which also marked their new notarial status as free Black subjects. A small subsection of fugitive groups appear in the notarial record at the moment they first begin negotiation with Spanish authorities on the terms of their surrender and settlement.

_19-20 de junio de 1579_

There is no direct indication in the text whether Don Luis spoke to the judges directly or through a translator. However, his ethnonym of “Mozambique” suggests that he had been enslaved and exported from southeast Africa. If that is the case, then he would almost certainly have been trafficked on multiple Portuguese vessels and may have spent time in Portuguese settlements in Atlantic Africa. Depending on his age at enslavement, which these records do not give us, he could have grown up multilingual with a mixture of African and European languages or he could have learned a creole lingua franca such as those common in Cape Verde and San Tome.[[1]](#_ftn1) Leo Garofalo suggests that multiply-transported Africans in the Iberian Atlantic often developed the linguistic and cultural skills to act as cultural brokers and intermediaries.[[2]](#_ftn2) This could have been a significant factor in Don Luis gaining followers among his fellow fugitives.

Regardless of which languages were spoken, Don Luis’s appearance before the court demonstrates the cross-cultural importance of embodied rituals of sovereignty. In this first century of Spanish colonization of the Americas, Spaniards performed rituals of sovereignty both in the Americas, for the purpose of territorial claims, and in West Africa, for the purpose of demonstrating respect to and requesting protection from West African sovereigns. Power relations were deeply weighted in favor of indigenous West African sovereigns when they encountered Iberian traders in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. Iberians’ ritualized declarations of deference to gain African sovereigns were necessary to conduct business there, including the business of buying human captives.[[3]](#_ftn3) Physical acts—such as prostrating, kneeling, interacting with symbolic objects, and sensory experiences of ritual food, drink, smoke, music, etc.—offered avenues for such rituals to be mutually experienced across a possible language barrier.

For the Spanish, the embodied rituals of authority were always combined with the authority of speech, a familiar practice in sources both on the Iberian Peninsula and in the Americas. The Spanish practiced an oratorial and notarial tradition adopted during the Reconquista—a standardized oration known as the _requerimiento_—in which opponents were exhorted to submit to the Catholic monarchs’ authority, on pain of a declaration of war. Patricia Seed calls the _requerimiento_ “authoritative discourse;” it was not intended to persuade the listener, but rather to obtain their compliance.[[4]](#_ftn4) The ceremonies on June 19 and 20 rely on multiple levels of oral performance to demonstrate the authority of all parties involved. The soldiers are under Don Luis’s command (“_debajo de la palabra”_), they have authorized Don Luis to speak for them (“_la palabra por mis soldados puesta en mi nombre”),_ and they are present to hear the judge’s performance of authority.

  On the nineteenth day of June, the president of the royal court, Juan López de Cepeda heard their petition. Cepeda was one year into what would ultimately be an eighteen-month stopover in Panamá. He had scarcely left his previous post as a judge in Lima, before he was summoned back to the Andes to spend the rest of his life as the president of the court at Charcas, perched atop the great silver mountain of Potosi.[^9.3](Based on Paul's responses, #FIND more info about Cepeda, add more about Potosi if you're going to mention it). Don Luis’s initial appearance before Lopez de Cepeda on June 19th and an appearance before the mayors the following day were both recorded in an extremely abbreviated shorthand by scribes present at the proceedings. On July 6, after all declarations had been agreed to, the notary Gabriel de Navarrete transcribed the earlier shorthand, combined and edited the events into a single narrative, and swore in the presence of two assistants that this was a true and faithful copy, fit for public record.[^9.4]

To quote at length:

Good sir: I, Luis, king of the Portobelo soldiers and in keeping with their word they have placed in my name, stand before you. With all the soldiers who were under my command, I ask that you give us freedom. In the name of King Philip, my lord to whom I come in peace and I pledge to obey, I ask that you give freedom to me and all my soldiers. Should you accept this, I stand before you that you might declare that I, and all those elsewhere I speak for, shall serve your majesty. Where your majesty orders me to settle with my people, I will go there. I have done this in paper and ink so that you may understand how sincerely I wish to serve Your Majesty, may Our Lord guard and keep you all the days of your life….

A Black man who said his name was Don Luis Mozambique presented this letter and petition to the court, at which point Andres Sanchez, soldier, confirmed he knew [LM] to be the man so named in the petition. And having read the petition before you sir [Lopez de Cepeda], he [LM] confirmed he understood and agreed to its contents.

At the same time [Lopez de Cepeda] presented a royal seal imprinted onto colored wax on white paper, and said that [LM] had been given [the seal] by this royal court as a signal of peace, for the security of himself, the soldiers he brought with him under his command, and those who he left behind in their settlements in the mountains. This seal [LM] received into his hands, and kissed it, and put it above his head and said he had obeyed and would obey with all due reverence. He said he is ready to give his word and assurances, and to assent to serve Your Majesty for the good and the peace of himself and the people that he has in his company.

  The following day the sheriff escorted Don Luis and his soldiers to the city hall, where they met with the mayors and repeated the ritual—kissing the seal, putting it above his head, swearing to obey will all due reverence. What can we learn about Don Luis and his people from this scene, given how much detail about these encounters has been filtered out by the various stages of transcription and the formulaic conventions of legal writing? Despite this mediation, several points in this account prompt closer examination of language, embodied ritual, and oral authority.
