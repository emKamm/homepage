Their leader was Don Luis Mozambique and he spoke for the men and women of “diverse nations that had united under him, as well as the children born and raised” [^7.1] in their _palenque,_ a term for fugitive slave settlements in the Spanish Americas. He gave the court the names of his neighbors and kin—28 men, 17 women, and 8 children—who would receive a declaration of their freedom that day. This list of names and relationships was recorded and signed by the notary Luis Sanchez, submitted to the records of the court, from whence it was funneled through the Spanish imperial bureaucracy to Seville and then Madrid. 

Within that list, it is striking to come across a familial scene so easy to conjure across time and distance: Mateo and Francisca, husband and wife, both listed with the ethnonym Congo, parents of three children between the ages of seven and ten.  How were Mateo and Francisca stolen away from their natal families a half a world away? Had Mateo driven mule trains back and forth through the rainforest, driven carriages through a city center, or loaded cargo at one of the ports? Had Francisca worked in the fledgling colony’s homes, farms, inns, or taverns? How had they taken flight into the mountains, how long had they fought to secure their freedom? There’s a bittersweetness to knowing many questions provoked by such a source cannot be directly answered.

What do the names tell us? The ethnonyms born by the members of Mozambique’s group are mixed: roughly fifty percent are listed with names suggesting origin points in the Senegambia region of West Africa and thirty percent with names connected to Central or Southern Africa (Congo and Mozambique). On the last day of June, the judges of the royal court in Panama signed the act declaring the freedom of Don Luis Mozambique and “all his subjects, both men and women, both those of various origins who became his subjects and those who were born and raised among [the fugitives].”[[1]](#_ftn1) The list of names and relationships given shows that this description of a diverse community was fairly accurate [Table 2]. Don Luis’s community was more ethnically heterogeneous than other groups of fugitives in Tierra Firme whose community demographics are similarly preserved, which show clear concentration of similar Senegambian ethnonyms.[[2]](#_ftn2)  The Senegambia region of West Africa was the primary

_In the list of names and relationships given the source, each adult man is given an ethnonym.

In Table 2, I have indicated this distinction by separating the data on women into “Stated” vs. “Implied.”_

region of slave trafficking during most of the sixteenth century, and roughly half of the ethnonyms given in this June 30 document refer back to that region.[[3]](#_ftn3) Another third of the community bore ethnonyms from elsewhere in Africa. There are eleven adults listed with the ethnonym Congo; including Don Luis, there are three men listed with the ethnonym Mozambique, each of whom is married to a woman who shares that designation.[[4]](#_ftn4) Finally, there are two adults whose ethnonym Criollo indicates that they had been born in the Americas.

The presence of a cluster of people identified as “Mozambique” can be interpreted in several ways.

When Spanish captain Antonio de Saucedo traveled to the newly established town of Santiago del Principe, one of his soldiers got into an argument with one of Pedro Sape’s soldiers. When a furious Saucedo demanded that he be given guides so he could immediately return to Panama, Don Luis Mozambique appeared on the scene to calm the captain’s temper. At the end of a series of conversations that diffused the situation, Don Luis told Saucedo why he hadn’t wanted the captain to leave in anger: “Sir, if you go to the royal court, your lie must be the truth, and our truth must be a lie.”[[5]](#_ftn5) Saucedo reports that several days later, he heard the town’s Black subjects discussing “King Don Luis.” Once again, Saucedo records his outrage: “I said ‘What is this King Don Luis? There is no other King here but our lord Philip’ and I said this at least six times… If I hear ‘King Don Luis’ one more time I will have to put you at sword point!”[[6]](#_ftn6) Don Luis pacifies the captain by guiding his subjects through the verbal and physical rituals of authority that Saucedo would have expected, instructing the men to remove their hats, to cross themselves, and to agree that they knew no king but King Philip. In his letter describing the incident, Saucedo gives himself the credit for ensuring these Black subjects’ appropriate allegiance. However, from an outside perspective and in the context of fugitive leaders’ skillful use of colonial expectations to their advantage, the dynamic of this scene reads very differently. Don Luis knew that to his subjects he could be King, but that deference to colonial authority must be performed at appropriate moments.
