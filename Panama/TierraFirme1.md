Meleiza Figueroa's 2010 map of "Rebel Slave Communities in the Americas" continues to circulate widely as a comprehensive picture of fugitive slave communities. 
I am adding to this map in several respects: geographically and chronologically. 
	1. Talk about Figueroa map 
	2. Zoom in to Isthmus, talk about what should be added to it
	3. There are many stories yet to add. I am starting with Santiago del Principe.
