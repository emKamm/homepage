The Port of Panama as the link between halves of a developing world system. It began with the Spanish, whose Pacific fleets would bring goods from Asia via the Philippines and silver from the South American Andes via Lima. These were the routes by which treasure flowed, and so these were the sites where administrative nodes in the network of Spanish colonial bureaucracy.
At the beginning of the seventeenth century, the Spanish Caribbean was valuable to empire as a pass-through place, with distinct inbound and outbound cycles of travel and transfer. In Panama’s ‘inbound’ case, the mineral riches of the Andes and the tropical products of the Pacific arrived in Panama City, moved overland on mule trains driven by enslaved muleteers up into the mountains, the treasure inbound to Spain. At the entrepot high in the interior mountains, the hoard would be transferred to the Chagres River’s many small craft, to take downstream to meet the fleet in Nombre de Dios. At that time, it was the location of the annual fair of the arriving galleons, although in 1597 it would move to Portobelo. This town is on the Caribbean side, it’s described as a classic pass-through place, where the character of the town depends entirely on whether it is in its ‘boom’ season. In the ‘outbound’ direction of the intra-imperial trade cycles, Spanish vessels would carry enslaved Africans from their initial disembarkation in Cartagena to the ports on the north shore of the isthmus (Wheat, Bassi, Garcia Monton, #FIND and expand) during their off season.  From there, these captive men and women would complete the above journey in reverse. Reaching the port of Panama, the vast majority of whom would not stay there, but would rather embark on yet another voyage, this time expanding the diaspora to the Spanish Americas (Bryant, O’Toole, Vinson, Walker, Seijas [EXPAND])
Recent work on the early slave trade to the Spanish Americas has emphasized the role that enslaved Africans played as surrogate settlers.[^4.1] The early understanding of circum-Caribbean slavery as being only about the sugar industry and sugar plantations leaves out the demographic dynamics of Spanish voluntary migration and West African forced migration. Spanish settlers were largely from the noble or professional classes, and were not inclined to take on agricultural or manual labor in the Americas.[^4.2] Criado de Castilla wrote that “Among the whites they neither have to serve, nor dedicate themselves to labor.” [^4.3] This statement is consistent with the population information he gives on the region as a whole [Table 1], stating that among the 500 householders of Panamá, only 15-20 of them “work the fields and live on the livestock that they have there.” [^4.4] The other 95% of the city’s heads of household were merchants and administrators engaged in the trade of goods and people that flowed through Panamá, the fulcrum upon which Spain’s globe-spanning extractive system rested.
