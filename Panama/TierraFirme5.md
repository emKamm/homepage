 How did the colonial world function in those spaces
	1.  On the sea, where guys who have high ambitions but aren't high born circulate (I don't know what I meant by that?)
		1.  Some of these guys are spanish, some are french or english, privateers are the non state entities trying to nibble off the edges of the wealth being produced by the Spanish empire in the silver mines, the pearl islands, the Asian porcelain, etc.
		2.  Within the cities lives the structured, legal world of the spanish vecinos. How does the legal world work there?  
		3.  And within those spanish colonial cities: How does the material world work? How is food produced, how is labor performed?
